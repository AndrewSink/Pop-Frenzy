I wanted to see if I could make a game using [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/) and three.js, and it actually worked pretty well! The functions were (mostly) created by ChatGPT, and the core logic of the game was designed using an iterative prompt-based approach.

I did my best not to create any functions, and only changed variables and added some minor HTML / CSS for clarity. The core Javascript was all created by ChatGPT, using a guided prompt approach (Ex. Create a function that scales a mesh Object on the X and Y axes by 2). 

ChatGPT worked surprisingly well!

It's not perfect and there are a few minor quirks, but overall a fun experience experimenting with ChatGPT. This was an expansion on my [first attempt at using ChatGPT to directly create 3D models](https://youtu.be/nVIMVBmAi_8), which worked pretty well but had some limitationos. 

ChatGPT also picked the title of the game and the tagline, and [Dall-E 2](https://openai.com/dall-e-2/) created the logo / favicon.
